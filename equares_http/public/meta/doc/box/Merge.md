### Data processing

The box has a variable number (1&ndash;10) of input ports &mdash; it is determined by the value of the **inputPortCount** parameter.
The input ports are named **in_1**, **in_2**, and so on.
The data at all input ports must have the same format, and this will also be the format of the output port.
The box sends each input data frame to port **output** as soon as it receives it.
