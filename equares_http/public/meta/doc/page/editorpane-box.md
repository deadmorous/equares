![](/meta/doc/page/editorpane-boxlist-1.png 'Box list pane')

Box list displays the list of all available =[box](/doc#page/general-items) types.
It is used to create box instances for the simulation being edited. To create a box, just drag it to the =[simulation scheme](/doc#page/editorpane-scheme) with the mouse.
Or click it, then its new instance will show up in the top-left corner of the scheme.

Short summary on a box type appears when you hover the question icon on the left of box name. If you click that icon, the detailed help information on the box is displayed in a new tab.

When user starts editing new simulation (by choosing the **Clear** command in =[editor](/editor) menu), the box list is shown in the pane on the left.

When a simultion is loaded, the box list is hidden, and the left pane displays [simulation information](/doc#page/editorpane-info). In this case the box list can be activated by clicking the **Show box list**
button in the simulation info pane (the info pane will close). Or you can show it using the **2** button on the left header bar (the info pane will remain).
See picture below.
