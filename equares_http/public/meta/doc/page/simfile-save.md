# Saving simulations

Registered users can store simulations on our server. To save a simulation, make sure you are logged in and take the following steps in the =[editor](/editor).

1. Specify simulation name &mdash; it is the **name** =[simulation property](/doc#page/editor-usage-simprop).<br/>
   ![simulation name property](/meta/doc/page/simfile-save-1.png "Simulation name property")
2. Select the **Save** command from editor menu.<br/>
   ![save simulation command](/meta/doc/page/simfile-save-2.png "Save simulation menu command")

**Note:** on our server, saved simulations are identified by username and simulation name.
If you specify the name of another your existing simulation in the **name** simulation property,
and then save your simulation, it will overwrite the old one (you will be warned about that).
You can also change the name of an existing simulation and save in order to clone the existing simulation.

Saved simulations can later be found and loaded using the =[simulation table](/simulations).
See =[Table of simulations](/doc#page/simfile-table) for more information.
