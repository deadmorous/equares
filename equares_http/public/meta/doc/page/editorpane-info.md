# Simulation information
![](/meta/doc/page/editorpane-info-1.png 'Simulation info pane')

The simulation info pane displays a description of current simulation. The description is taken from the **info** [simulation property](/doc#page/editor-usage-simprop).

When a simultion is loaded, the box list is shown in the pane on the left.

When user starts editing new simulation (by choosing the **Clear** command in =[editor](/editor) menu), the info pane is hidden, and the left pane displays
the [box list](/doc#page/editorpane-box). In this case the info pane can be activated by clicking the **Show info pane**
button in the box list pane (the box list pane will close). Or you can show it using the **1** button on the left header bar (the box list pane will remain).
See picture below.
