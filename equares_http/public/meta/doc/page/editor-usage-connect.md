# Making connections

=[Box ports](/doc#page/general-items) are connected by links in order to create logical =[data](/doc#page/general-data) channels.

The creation of a link between two ports is as easy as pressing the left mouse button on one port and releasing it on the other port.

**Note**
* A link can only be created between an input port
  (![input port](/meta/doc/page/editorpane-scheme-port-in.png)) and an output port (![output port](/meta/doc/page/editorpane-scheme-port-out.png)).
  It cannot connect two input ports or two output ports.
* Only one link can be connected to an input port.

Once a link is created, it can be deleted by just clicking it. Link will also be deleted if you delete the box containing link target port.
