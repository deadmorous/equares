# Quicksave feature

Each time you modify anything in your simulation, the =[editor](/editor) automatically saves the simulation on our server. The area where the simulation is stored this way
is called the **quicksave area**.

If you are not logged in, the quicksave area on the server is destroyed as soon as your browser session expires.

If you are logged in, the quicksave area will persist across browser sessions.

Notice that the quicksave feature is provided to protect you against data loss when occasionally leaving editor page.
To make your simulation persistent, you should give it a name and then =[save it](/doc#page/simfile-save).
