# Table of simulations

The =[table of simulations](/simulations) shows all =[public](/doc#page/editor-usage-simprop) simulations or all simulation belonging to the user currently logged in.
To navigate to the table of simulation, use the **Simulations** menu item or one of its nested items.

![simtable menu](/meta/doc/page/simfile-table-1.png "Menu commands to access table of simulations")

Figure below shows the page with the simulation table.

Notice the search bar at the top. It can be used to filter the list of simulation and easily find the simulation you are looking for.

Basic filtering mode of the search bar provides one text search field. The text you enter here will be looked for in the following =[simulation properties](/doc#page/editor-usage-simprop):
**name**, **description**, **info**, **keywords**

There is also the advanced filter mode activated as you click the **Advanced** link on the right of the search bar.

In the advanced mode, you can also
* find public simulations belonging to specific user (or all of your own simulations);
* find simulations by exact keyword match;
* limit the list of your simulations to public ones.

Once you have located a simulation in the table, you can
* open it in the =[editor](/editor) by clicking the link labeled with simulation name<br/>
  (**Note:** previous simulation in the =[quicksave](/doc#page/simfile-quick) area will be lost!);
* change its name and the public attribute by clicking the ![edit](/images/edit.png) icon (only for your simulations);
* remove it by clicking the ![trash](/images/trash.png) icon (only for your simulations).
