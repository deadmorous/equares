# Snippets

Snippets are pieces of code and documentation that can be used as values of certain box properties.
For example, there are **ode** snippets that can be used as values of the ```src``` property of the =[CxxOde](/doc#box/CxxOde) box.

With snippets, it is easy to replace one equation with another in a simulation. You just display the property value in the text editor
and press the **Snippets** button. Then choose a snippet from the list and pick it by pressing the **Pick** button.
See =[Using snippets](/doc#page/editor-usage-snippets) for more information.

Snippets are typed. This means that a type name is assigned to each snippet. Snippets of each type are for use with properties declaring that
snippet type as supported.

There are a number of built-in snippets. Users can easily add their own snippets. Once a user adds a snippet, it can be shared by all users.

All snippets can be viewed in documentation &mdash; e.g., see [ODE snippets](/doc#snippet/ode).
