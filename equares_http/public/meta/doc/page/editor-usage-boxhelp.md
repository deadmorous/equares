# Displaying box help

There are two ways to display help page on specific box type from the =[editor](/editor).

1. If you are looking at the =[box list pane](/doc#page/editorpane-box), click question mark to the left of box type you want help on.<br/>
   ![help-boxlist](/meta/doc/page/editor-usage-boxhelp-1.png "Help icons in the box list")
2. If you have selected a box on the =[simulation scheme](/doc#page/editorpane-scheme) look at the **type** property in the
   =[object parameters pane](/doc#page/editorpane-prop). Next to the drop-down list of box types you will find the **help** hyperlink
   that brings you to the help page on the type of currently selected box.<br/>
