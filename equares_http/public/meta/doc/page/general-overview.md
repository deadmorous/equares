# Basic idea

Equares provides a way to investigate dynamic systems numerically.
An investigation is done by **simulation**. Simulation itself is a description of what and how needs to be done.

User prepares a simulation by creating **boxes** and connecting them by **links**. It's also necessary to specify **parameters** of all boxes.

Once a simulation is prepared, it can be run. Running a simulation produces the result of investigation. The output of a simulation consists of one or more text files and/or images.

This service allows registered users to prepare, run, store, and share simulations.

# Signing up

In order to be able to use full functionality of the service, it's necessary to sign up and then log in.
The registration is simple &mdash; use the **Sign up** link in the top-right corner of the window.

# Exploring examples

It's good to start from exploring several examples that we've prepared.
Go to the ?[editor](http:///editor), then locate the **Examples** submenu in the editor's menu, and click an example to load it.
You can run any simulations, unless you are not logged in.
