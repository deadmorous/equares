# Creating boxes

To create a new instance of a box, take the following steps.
1. Drag box of appropriate type from the =[box list](/doc#page/editorpane-box) onto the =[simulation scheme](/doc#page/editorpane-scheme).
2. Enter a **name** for the new box instance in the =[object parameters](/doc#page/editorpane-prop) pane.

Once a box instance is created, at any time you can
* remove it by clicking its ![close](/images/close.png) icon;
* =[change its type](/doc#page/editor-usage-replacebox);
* position it by dragging it around (press and hold left mouse button on the box, then move the mouse);
* =[edit its parameters](/doc#page/editor-usage-boxprop);
* =[connect it with other boxes](/doc#page/editor-usage-connect).
