# Loading simulations

Simulations stored on the server can be loaded from the =[simulation table](/simulations).
See =[Table of simulations](/doc#page/simfile-table) for more information.

You can also upload and downlad simulations. Use the **Upload** command in the editor menu
to upload simulation file to the editor, and the **Download** command to download a file with current simulation
to your computer.

Last but not least, you can load a simulation from the **Examples** menu in the =[editor](/editor).
The menu contains a list of predefined simulations that are designed to be starting points of your own ones.
